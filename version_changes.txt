====================
Version 0.9.1:
====================
Patch to version 0.9, release in December 2015. This patch fixes a number of bugs that were introduced between versions 0.8 and 0.9. 

Bug fixes include:
- Fixed error in strain calculation in getRHS, previously it missed some terms in 3D calculations
- Fixed formatting for output filenames after the 999,999th outptu
- Fixed a sign error in the residuals in the beta prime precipitate application
- Fixed symmetry error in generation of the stiffness tensor for 2D anisotropic calculations
- Fixed error in the mechanics solver where solution was erroneously set to the change in the solution
- Updated the namespace for MPI calls to comply with Deal.II v8.3 specifications

Added functionality:
- Changed mesh generation to allow for elements with a different aspect ratio than the domain

Known issues:
- Code runs more slowly than version 0.8, possibly due to compiler flags set by Deal.II that are disabling vectorization
- Yields different solutions for time evolution equations than version 0.8

====================
Version 0.9:
====================
Released in September 2015 before the PRISMS Workshop. A large portion of the code was refactored so that much more of the source code is shared between applications. In the previous version, each application was nearly independent. 

Known issues:
- Code runs more slowly than version 0.8, possibly due to compiler flags set by Deal.II that are disabling vectorization
- Yields different solutions for time evolution equations than version 0.8

====================
Version 0.8:
====================
First public release of the code.
