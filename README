What is phaseField@PRISMS?

  phaseField@PRISMS is a C++ code implementing various phase field and mechanics models
  and its applications to some physical problems (spinodal decomposition,
  precipitate growth, coupled transport+mechanics, etc)

  It targeted at the computational solution of related partial differential equations
  using the finite element method, and is build on top of the deal.II finite element 
  library (http://www.dealii.org) 
  
  This code is developed by the PRedictive Integrated Structural Materials Science (PRISMS) 
  Center at University of Michigan which is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, 
  Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering under 
  Award #DE-SC0008637

Installation and Use:

  1) Configure, compile and install the deal.II library. No additional libraries are 
     required besides the installation of deal.ii with the following configuration flags:
     -DDEAL_II_WITH_MPI=ON  
     -DDEAL_II_WITH_P4EST=ON 
     -DDEAL_II_WITH_LAPACK=ON

     Download: http://www.dealii.org/download.html
     Detailed instructions: http://www.dealii.org/8.1.0/readme.html
      
  2) Running phaseField applications, for example cahnHilliard 
  $ cd applications/cahnHilliard
  $ cmake CMakeLists.txt
  $ make
  For serial runs:
  $ make run
  For parallel runs:
  $ mpiexec -np nprocs ./main


Getting started:

  The applications are located under /applications and each application has a detailed 
  README with instructions and related documentation. 

  Applications are intended to serve as (1) demonstration of the capabilities of this library.
  and (2) Provide a framework for further development of specialized/advanced applications by 
  users. Currently the following applications are provided:
  cahnHilliard
  allenCahn
  mechanics	
  coupledCahnHilliardAllenCahn
  betaPrimePrecipitate

  Applications under development/testing are preceded by an underscore, such as:
  _fickianFlux
  _coupledFickianFluxMechanics
  _coupledCahnHilliardMechanics
